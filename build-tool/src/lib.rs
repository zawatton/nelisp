//! NeLisp build-time tool — Doc 47 §3.1 phase 6 carve-out.
//!
//! Hosts the Doc 44 minimal interpreter (reader + evaluator + Elisp
//! self-host bridge) so the `nelisp-runtime` ship crate stays
//! image-only.  Per Doc 47 §1.1 the long-term split is:
//!
//! ```text
//! nelisp-runtime    = seed loader + image boot + syscall thin-wrappers
//!                     (target ≤ 4,000 LOC, image-only)
//! nelisp-build-tool = reader + minimal evaluator + dumper
//!                     (Doc 44 minimal interpreter lives here)
//! ```
//!
//! Stage 5a created the workspace + empty crate.  Stage 5b moved
//! `bin/nelisp.rs` here.  Stage 5c (this commit) `git mv`-ed
//! `eval/`, `reader/`, `bridge/` across from `nelisp-runtime/src/`
//! and re-wired the `anvil-runtime` consumer to depend on this
//! crate instead.  Future Stage 6+ will add the dumper that bakes a
//! heap evaluated by these modules into a `nelisp.image` v1 file.
